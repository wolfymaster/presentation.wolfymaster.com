						Lets introduce Computer Science a little bit to start off
						Who can give me a definition or tell me what Computer Science is? 
						My definition is vary basic - but much easier to understand. We use computers, which can do things much faster and much more accurate than a person can do to help us solve problems faster and more reliably. 
						But.. there is one big thing that makes this sometimes pretty tricky to do....

							Computers aren't very smart. We have to tell them exactly what we want them to do. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Computers have their own language, just like English or Spanish or French or German. In order for the computer to understand what you 
							are telling it to do, you must communicate using a programming language.

							Now that we have a definition of what Computer Science is, lets look at how the field is expanding.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I started getting into into programming, it was the early 2000s and the internet was just starting to become how it is known today.
							Computer Science wasn't changing too quickly. No wifi. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In the mid-late 2000s things started to pick up in the industry and things began to update pretty regularly.

							There is a huge demand in this field. There will be more jobs than CS graduates to fill those jobs.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's never too early to start learning programming. The longer you wait the more you fall behind.
						</p>
						<p>
							Does not mean you need a college degree. This is a field where is 100% possible for you to learn on your own and be successful. Sometimes that's better than going to college.
							Programming is only a piece - its a core foundation of Computer Science, but the field has greatly expanded.

						What does a Senior Software Engineer Do?
					</h2>
					
					<p style="font-size:28px;">
						<strong>Senior : </strong>Manages a team. Oversees projects and assists other developers with difficult problems.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:28px;">
						<strong>Software Engineer : </strong>Creates software that solves complex issues usually related to mission critical business activities. Aware of how systems function and interact at a low level.
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>50% programming</li>
						<li>30% database</li>
						<li>20% operations</li>
					</ul>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So that brings us here ...
							I mentioned at the beginning that I would talk about what I do later.. now is later.
						</p>
						<p>
							Breakdown the works, then put them together it is essentially someone who writes software and understands core mission critical systems and how they interact with one another.

						I work remotely, and I have no family so my typical day will be unique. There are a lot of careers in this field that are able to be done remotely.
							Usually the schedule is a little more relaxed and you are able to achieve a work/life balance. For instance, I play basketball or go for runs almost every day. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It's super important in this field that you get up and away from the computer because you end up spending way more time on the computer than most people do anyway.

						I don't have very many flashy screens or things to show that would make any sense to you. Most of what I do is build automation - which mean anything that is already
						built, shouldn't need me to do much interaction with it - it runs by itself.

							What I can show tho is some of the requests or scenerios I deal with.

						A program takes 10 minutes per client to run. Last year we had 5 clients, so the program took 50 minutes to run. This year we have 20 clients,
