						Lets introduce Computer Science a little bit to start off

						My definition is vary basic - but much easier to understand. We use computers, which can do things much faster and much more accurate than a person can do to help us solve problems faster and more reliably. 
						But.. there is one big thing that makes this sometimes pretty tricky to do....

						I work remotely, and I have no family so my typical day will be unique. There are a lot of careers in this field that are able to be done remotely.
							Usually the schedule is a little more relaxed and you are able to achieve a work/life balance. For instance, I play basketball or go for runs almost every day.

							It's super important in this field that you get up and away from the computer because you end up spending way more time on the computer than most people do anyway.
